# Exploit Exercises Solutions

The [Exploit Exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com/) are really fun to play with.
I spent a few minutes up to a few hours on each of the levels.
I created these scripts to keep a documentation as a working example at hand to know exactly which steps were necessary to solve each challenge.
If you see any improvements to my solutions, feel free to suggest them ;)

# Setup

Go to https://exploit-exercises.com/ and download the VM.

## Network

One way to make the machine available over the network is to choose 'NAT', select 'cable connected' and forward the SSH port to your local network interface:
```
Name: SSH
Protocol: TCP
Host IP: 127.0.0.1
Host Port: 22022 (you are free to choose whichever free port between 1024 and 65535 you like)
Guest IP: You got to figure this one out yourself, eg. log into the machine and run 'ifconfig'.
Guest Port: 22
```

# Run

E.g. to solve level nr 5 of the nebula challenge run:
```
./run localhost 22022 nebula 05
```

# Disclaimer

I decided to script the solutions in bash because it's really straight forward to do.
However, since we're talking about security here, bash is a very fragile language when it comes to security, as you will also learn during the challenges.
I did not (yet) focus on making them safe, I might improve them in the future, but for now, if you want to use bash in the wild don't follow my sloppy code style here.
